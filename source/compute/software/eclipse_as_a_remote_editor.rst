.. _Eclipse as remote editor:

Eclipse as a remote editor
==========================

Prerequisites
-------------

-  The user should be familiar with the basic use of the Eclipse IDE.
-  `Eclipse`_ has been installed on the user's desktop or laptop.
   We advise to install the bundle 'Eclipse IDE for Scientific Computing' 
   of a recent Eclipse release as they
   contain a lot of other useful tools, including the 'Remote System
   Explorer' used here. This page was tested with
   the 2019-06 release.
-  The user should have a VSC account and be able to access it.

Installing additional components
--------------------------------

In order to use Eclipse as a remote editor, you may have to install two
extra components: the "Remote System Explorer End-User Runtime" and
the "Remote System Explorer User Actions". Here is how to do this:

#. From Eclipse's 'Help' menu, select 'Install New Software...', the
   following dialog will appear:
   
   .. figure:: eclipse_as_a_remote_editor/install_software.png

#. From the 'Work with:' drop down menu, select '<name> -
   http://download.eclipse.org/releases/<name>' (replace "<name>" by
   the name of the release that you are using, e.g., 2019-06). 
   The list of available components is now automatically populated.

#. From the category 'General Purpose Tools', select 'Remote System
   Explorer End-User Runtime' and 'Remote System Explorer User Actions'.

#. Click the 'Next >' button to get the installation details.

#. Click the 'Next >' button again to review the licenses.

#. Select the 'I accept the terms of the license agreement' radio
   button.

#. Click the 'Finish' button to start the download and installation
   process.

#. As soon as the installation is complete, you will be prompted to
   restart Eclipse, do so by clicking the 'Restart Now' button.

After restarting, the installation process of the necessary extra
components is finished, and they are ready to be configured.

Configuration
-------------

Before the new components can be used, some configuration needs to be
done.

Microsoft Windows users who use the PuTTY SSH client software should
first prepare a private key for use with Eclipse's authentication
system. Users using the OpenSSH client on Microsoft Windows, Linux or
macOS may need to convert their private key to an older format.

Microsoft Windows PuTTY users only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eclipse's SSH components can not handle private keys generated with
PuTTY, only OpenSSH compliant private keys. However, PuTTY's key
generator 'PuTTYgen' (that was used to generate the public/private key
pair in the first place) can be used to convert the PuTTY private key to
one that can be used by Eclipse. See ":ref:`converting PuTTY keys`".

Microsoft Windows PuTTY users should now proceed with the instructions
for all users, below.

OpenSSH ssh-keygen users only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using a recent version of OpenSSH, your private key will not 
be compatible with certain modules in Eclipse. Moreover, Eclipse does not
yet fully support ed25519 keys. Keys in the new format start with
the line ``-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----``.

One solution is to generate a new RSA 4096-bit key for use with Eclipse:

::

   $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_vsc_PEM
    
will generate a key and store it in a format compatible with Eclipse.
You can then upload your public key as an additional key to the 
`VSC account page`_ using the instructions to add another key on the   
:ref:`Access from multiple machines <access_multiple_computers>` page. 

If you have a 4096-bit RSA private key in the wrong format, another option is to
simply convert the private key to the PEM format.  Assuming your private key
file is called `Ã¬d_rsa_vsc``, then the conversion can be done using

::

   $ cd ~/.ssh
   $ ssh-keygen -e -p -m PEM -f id_rsa_vsc >id_rsa_vsc_PEM


All users
~~~~~~~~~

#. From the 'Window' menu ('Eclipse' menu on macOS), select
   'Preferences'.
#. In the category 'General', expand the subcategory 'Network
   Connections' and select 'SSH2'.
#. Point Eclipse to the directory where the OpenSSH private key is
   stored that is used for authentication on the VSC cluster. Next,
   select your key by clicking the 'Add Private Key...' button.
#. Close the 'Preferences' dialog by clicking 'OK'.

Creating a remote connection
----------------------------

In order to work on a remote system, a connection should be created
first.

#. From the 'Window' menu, select 'Perspective', then
   'Open Perspective' and then
   'Other...', a dialog like the one below will open (the exact contents
   depends on the components installed in Eclipse).

   .. figure:: eclipse_as_a_remote_editor/open_perspective.png

#. Select 'Remote System Explorer' from the list, and press 'OK', now
   the 'Remote Systems' view appears (at the left by default).

#. In that view, right-click and select 'New' and then 'Connection' from
   the context menu, the 'New Connection' dialog should now appear.

#. From the 'System type' list, select 'SSH Only' and press 'Next >'.

#. In the 'Host name' field, enter *vsc.login.node*, in the 'Connection
   Name' field, the same host name will appear automatically. The latter
   can be changed if desired. Optionally, a description can be added as
   well. Click 'Next >' to continue.

#. In the dialog 'Sftp Files' nothing needs to be changed, so just click
   'Next >'.

#. In the dialog 'Ssh Shells' nothing needs to be changed either, so
   again just click 'Next >'.

#. In the dialog 'Ssh Terminals' (newer versions of Eclipse) nothing
   needs to be changed either, click 'Finish'.

The new connection has now been created successfully. It can now be
used.

Browsing the remote file system
-------------------------------

One of the features of Eclipse 'Remote systems' component is browsing a
remote file system.

#. In the 'Remote Systems' view, expand the 'Sftp Files' item under the
   newly created connection, 'My Home' and 'Root' will appear.

#. Expand 'My Home', a dialog to enter your password will appear.

#. First enter your user ID in the 'User ID' field, by default this will
   be your user name on your local desktop or laptop. Change it to your
   VSC user ID.

#. Mark the 'Save user ID' checkbox so that Eclipse will remember your
   user ID for this connection.

#. Click 'OK' to proceed, leaving the 'Password' field blank.

#. If the login node is not in your known_hosts file, you will be
   prompted about the authenticity of vsc.login.node, confirm that you
   want to continue connecting by clicking 'Yes'.

#. If no know_hosts exists, Eclipse will prompt you to create one,
   confirm this by clicking 'Yes'.

#. You will now be prompted to enter the passphrase for your private
   key, do so and click 'OK'. 'My Home' will now expand and show the
   contents of your home directory on the VSC cluster.

Any file on the remote file system can now be viewed or edited using
Eclipse as if it were a local file.

It may be convenient to also display the content of your data directory
(i.e., '$VSC_DATA'). This can be accomplished easily by creating a new
filter.

#. Right-click on the 'Sftp Files' item in your VSC connection ('Remote
   Systems' view), and select 'New' and then 'Filter...' from the
   context menu.

#. In the 'Folder' field, type the path to your data directory (or use
   'Browse...'). If you don't know where your data directory is located,
   type 'echo $VSC_DATA' on the login's command line to see its value.
   Leave all other fields and checkboxes to their default values and
   press 'Next >'.

#. In the field 'Filter name', type any name you find convenient, e.g.,
   'My Data'. leave the checkbox to its default value and click
   'Finish'.

A new item called 'My Data' now appeared under VSC's 'Sftp Files' and
can be expanded to see the files in '$VSC_DATA'. Obviously, the same can
be done for your scratch directory.

Using an Eclipse terminal
-------------------------

The 'Remote Systems' view also allows to open a terminal to the remote
connection. This can be used as an alternative to the PuTTY or OpenSSH
client and may be convenient for software development (compiling,
building and running programs) without leaving the Eclipse IDE.

A new terminal can be launched from the 'Remote Systems' view by
right-clicking the VSC connection's 'Ssh Shells' item and selecting
'Launch Terminal' or 'Launch...' (depending on the version of Eclipse).
The 'Terminals' view will open (bottom of the screen by default).

Connecting/Disconnecting
------------------------

Once a connection has been created, it is trivial to connect to it
again. To connect to a remote host, right-click on the VSC cluster
connection in the 'Remote Systems' view, and select 'Connect' from the
context menu. You may be prompted to provide your private key's
passphrase.

For security reasons, it may be useful to disconnect from the VSC
cluster when Eclipse is no longer used to browse or edit files. Although
this happens automatically when you exit the Eclipse IDE, you may want
to disconnect without leaving the applicaiton.

To disconnect from a remote host, right-click on the VSC cluster
connection in the 'Remote Systems' view, and select 'Disconnect' from
the context menu.

Further information
-------------------

More information on Eclipse's capabilities to interact with remote
systems can be found in the Eclipse help files that were automatically
installed with the respective components. The information can be
accessed by selecting 'Help Contents' from the 'Help' menu, and is
available under 'RSE User Guide' heading.
