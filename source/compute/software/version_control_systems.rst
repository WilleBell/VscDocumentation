Version control systems
=======================

Why use a version control system?
---------------------------------

A version control system (VCS) helps you to manage the changes to the
source files of your project, and most systems also support team
development. Since it remembers the history of your files, you can
always return to an earlier version if you've screwed up making changes.
By adding comments when you store a new version in the VCS it also
becomes much easier to track which change was made for what purpose at
what time. And if you develop in a team, it helps to organise making
coordinated changes to the code base, and it supports co-development
even across file system borders (e.g., when working with a remote
partner).

Most Integrated Development Environments (IDE) offer support for one or
more version control systems. E.g., Eclipse, the IDE which we recommend
for the development of C/C++ or Fortran codes on clusters, supports all
of the systems mentioned on this page, some out-of-the-box and others by
adding an additional package. The systems mentioned on this page are all
available on Linux, macOS and Windows through the Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL).

Types of version control systems
--------------------------------

An excellent introduction to the various types of version control
systems can be found in `the book Pro GIT by Scott Chacon and Ben
Straub <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2>`__.

Centralised systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Centralised version control systems were developed to enable people to
collaborate on code and documents with people on different systems that
may not share a common file system. The version files are now maintained
by a server to which multiple clients can connect and check out files,
and the systems help to manage concurrent changes to a file by several
users (through a copy-modify-merge procedure). Popular examples of this
type are `CVS (Concurrent Versions System) 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System>`_ and :ref:`SVN
(Subversion) <Subversion>`. Of those two, SVN is the more recent system while
CVS is no longer further developed and less and less used.

Command-line clients are included in most Linux distributions and macOS and
Windows (WSL). The command line client is also available on the VSC
clusters.

`TortoiseSVN <https://tortoisesvn.net/>`__ is a popular Windows
native GUI client that integrates well with the explorer. However,
if you google on *SVN GUI* you'll find a plethora of other
choices, not only for Windows but also for macOS and Linux.

SVN can be integrated with the Eclipse IDE through the *Subversive
SVN team provider* plugin which can be installed through the
*Install New Software* panel in the help menu. More information
and instructions are available on the `Subversive subsite of the
main Eclipse web site <http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/>`__.

Distributed systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The weak point of the centralised systems is that they require you to be
online to checkout a file or to commit a revision. In a distributed
system, the clients mirror the complete repository and not just the
latest version of each file. When online, the user can then synchronise
the local repository with the copy on a server. In a single-user
scenario you can still keep all your files in the local repository
without using a server, and hence it doesn't make sense anymore to still
use one of old local-only version control systems. The disadvantage of a
distributed system is that you are not forced to synchronise after every
commit, so that the local repositories of various users on a project can
be very much out-of-sync with each other, making the job harder when
those versions have to be merged again.

Popular examples of systems of this type are :ref:`Git` (originally developed
to manage the Linux kernel project) and `Mercurial <https://www.mercurial-scm.org>`_
(sometimes abbreviated as Hg, chemists will understand why).

The command-line tool for Git is available on the VSC clusters.

   git

If you have a Linux system, Git is most likely already installed on your
system. On macOS, git is available through Xcode, though it is not always the
most recent version. On Windows, you can use WSL. Downloads for all systems are
also available on `the download section of the main git web site
<https://git-scm.com/download>`__. That page also contains links to a number of
GUI options. Most if not all GUI tools store projects in a way that is fully
compatible with the command line tools, so you can use both simultaneously. The
command line client is also available on the VSC clusters.

Another nice GUI application is
`SourceTree <https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree>`__
produced by `Atlassian <https://www.atlassian.com/>`__.
Atlassian is the company behind the Bitbucket cloud service, but their tool
also works well with GitHub, one of their main competitors. It has a very nice
way of representing the history of a local repository.

The Eclipse IDE comes with built-in support for Git through the standard
plug-in EGit. More recent versions of this plugin may be available through the
`Eclipse Marketplace <https://marketplace.eclipse.org/>`__.

Cloud services
--------------

Many companies offer hosting services for SVN, Git or Mercurial
repositories in the cloud.
Several offer free public hosting for Open Source projects or have free
access for academic accounts. Some noteworthy ones that are popular for
academic projects are:

- `GitHub (github.com) <https://github.com/>`__ offers free :ref:`git`
  and Subversion hosting for Open Source projects. We use this service
  for some VSC in-house tools development. It is also possible to host
  private projects if you subscribe to one of their paying plans or 
  register as an academic usser.

- `GitLab (gitlab.com) <https://gitlab.com/>`__ also offers free public
  and private repositories.

- `SourceForge <https://sourceforge.net/>`__ is a very well
  known service for hosting Open Source projects. It currently supports
  projects managed through Subversion, Git, Mercurial and a few other
  systems.

However, we urge you to always carefully check the terms-of-use of these
services to assure that, e.g., the way they deal with intellectual
property is in line with your institute's requirements.  Also note that some
institutes provide version control services.

Which one should I use?
-----------------------

It is not up to us to make this choice for you, but here are a number of
elements that you should take into account:

- Use a cloud service if you can, since this ensures that your code
  is safely stored off-site.  However, verify this is in line with
  the intellectual property policies of your institute.

- Subversion, Git and Mercurial are all recent systems that are well
  maintained and supported by several hosting services.  Git currently
  seems the most popular choice and the VSC provides training sessions
  on Git.

- Subversion and Git are installed on most VSC systems. We use Git
  ourselves for some of our in-house development.
- Centralised version management systems have a simpler concept than
  the distributed ones, but if you expect prolonged periods that you
  are offline, you have to keep in mind that you cannot make any
  commits during that period.

- As you have only a single copy of the repository in a centralised
  system, a reliable hosting service or a good backup strategy is
  important. In a distributed system it would still be possible to
  reconstruct the contents of a repository from the other repositories.

- If you want to use an IDE, it is good to check which systems are
  supported by the IDE. E.g., Eclipse supports Git out-of-the-box, and
  Subversion and Mercurial through a plug-in. Visual Studio also
  supports all three of these systems.
