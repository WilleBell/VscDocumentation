Books about Parallel Computing
==============================

This is a very incomplete list, permanently under construction, of
books about parallel computing.

General
-------

-  G. Hager and G. Wellein. `Introduction to high performance computing for
   scientists and engineers <https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-High-Performance-Computing-for-Scientists-and-Engineers/Hager-Wellein/p/book/9781439811924>`_.
   Chapman & Hall, 2010. This book first introduces the architecture of modern cache-based microprocessors and discusses their inherent performance limitations, before describing general optimization strategies for serial code on cache-based architectures. It next covers shared- and distributed-memory parallel computer architectures and the most relevant network topologies. After discussing parallel computing on a theoretical level, the authors show how to avoid or ameliorate typical performance problems connected with OpenMP. They then present cache-coherent nonuniform memory access (ccNUMA) optimization techniques, examine distributed-memory parallel programming with message passing interface (MPI), and explain how to write efficient MPI code. The final chapter focuses on hybrid programming with MPI and OpenMP.
-  V. Eijkhout. `Introduction to high performance scientific
   computing <https://insidehpc.com/2010/12/download-introduction-to-high-performance-scientific-computing/>`_.
   2011. This is a textbook that teaches the bridging topics between
   numerical analysis, parallel computing, code performance, large scale
   applications. It can be freely downloaded from `the author's page on
   the book <http://pages.tacc.utexas.edu/~eijkhout/istc/istc.html>`_
   (though you have to respect the copyright of course).
-  A. Grama, A. Gupta, G. Kapyris, and V. Kumar. `Introduction to
   parallel computing (2nd edition) <http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/Bookshop/detail.asp?item=100000000005961>`_.
   Pearson Addison Wesley, 2003. ISBN 978-0-201-64865-2. A somewhat
   older book, but still used a lot as textbook in academic courses on
   parallel computing.
-  C. Lin and L. Snyder. `Principles of parallel programming
   <http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/bookshop/detail.asp?WT.oss=Principles%20of%20parallel%20programming&WT.oss_r=1&item=100000000247080>`_.
   Pearson Addison Wesley, 2008. ISBN 978-0-32148790-2. This books
   discusses parallel programming both from a more abstract level and a
   more practical level, touching briefly threads programming, OpenMP,
   MPI and PGAS-languages (using ZPL).

   The books replace the earlier editions of "Using MPI: Portable
   Parallel Programming with the Message-Passing Interface" and the
   book "Using MPI-2: Advanced Features of the Message-Passing
   Interface".
