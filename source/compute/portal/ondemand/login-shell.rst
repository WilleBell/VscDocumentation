Login shell
===========

When selecting 'Login (Server) Shell Access' from the 'Clusters' menu, you will
get a terminal window in a new browser tab.  You will arrive on one of the login
nodes, which you can use in the same way as with terminal-based SSH access.
Remember, however, that login nodes are not meant for compute-intensive
calculations.  If you would like to perform calculations in an interactive job,
you should use the :ref:`ood_interactive_shell`.
