Active jobs
-----------

The 'Jobs - Active Jobs' menu item lists all your running, queued and completed
jobs. Completed jobs will disappear from this view after some time (a couple of
minutes or one day, depending on the cluster).  A handy overview is shown when
you click the large arrow next to the job ID. It shows job details , including
the node list, the account you used, the status of the job, and more.  It also
gives you the option to open the job script directory in the file manager
(``Open in File Manager`` button) or in the terminal (``Open in Terminal``
button), and thus inspect the created output and error files.

If your job is still running, you can also cancel it by clicking the bin under
'Actions'. (Refresh the page to confirm it actually stopped running).
Re-submitting a previous job can be done via the 'My Interactive Sessions' menu
or in the :ref:`ood_job_composer`.
