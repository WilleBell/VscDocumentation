Access to Globus
----------------

Log in with your institution:

Visit `www.globus.org`_ and click :bgrnd1:`Login` at the top of the page. On
the Globus login page, choose an organization you are already registered with,
such as your school or your employer.

When you find it, click :bgrnd1:`Continue`. If you cannot find your
organization in the list please contact the support team at data@vscentrum.be.

You will be redirected to your organization's login page. Use your credentials
for that organization to login.

If that is your first time logging into Globus some organizations may ask for
your permission to release your account information to Globus. In most cases
that would be a one-time request.

Once you have logged in with your organization, Globus will ask if you would
like to link to an existing account. If this is your first time logging in to
Globus, click :bgrnd1:`Continue`. If you have already used another account with
Globus, you can choose :bgrnd1:`Link to an existing account`.

You may be prompted to provide additional information such as your organization
and whether or not Globus will be used for commercial purposes. Complete the
form and click :bgrnd1:`Continue`.

Finally, you need to give Globus permission to use your identity to access
information and perform actions (like file transfers) on your behalf.
