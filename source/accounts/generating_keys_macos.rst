:fab:`apple` Generating keys on macOS
#####################################

Every macOS install comes with its own implementation of `OpenSSH`_, so you
don't need to install any third-party software to use it. Just open a
Terminal window and jump in!

Requirements
============

* macOS operating system
* `OpenSSH`_

Create a public/private key pair
================================

Generating a public/private key pair on macOS is identical to what is described
for :ref:`generating keys linux`. The underlying implementation of SSH in macOS
is the same `OpenSSH`_ used on Linux systems, so the same commands with the
same syntax apply.
