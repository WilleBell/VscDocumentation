.. _ssh proxy with PuTTY:

Setting up an SSH proxy with PuTTY
==================================

.. warning::

   If you simply want to configure PuTTY to connect to login nodes
   of the VSC clusters, this is not the page you are looking for.
   Please check out :ref:`how to configure PuTTY
   <text mode access using PuTTY>`.

Rationale
---------

ssh provides a safe way of connecting to a computer, encrypting traffic
and avoiding passing passwords across public networks where your traffic
might be intercepted by someone else. Yet making a server accessible
from all over the world makes that server very vulnerable. Therefore
servers are often put behind a *firewall*, another computer or device
that filters traffic coming from the internet.

In the VSC, all clusters are behind a firewall, but for the tier-1
cluster muk this firewall is a bit more restrictive than for other
clusters. Muk can only be approached from certain other computers in the
VSC network, and only via the internal VSC network and not from the
public network. To avoid having to log on twice, first to another login
node in the VSC network and then from there on to Muk, one can set up a
so-called *ssh proxy*. You then connect through another computer (the
*proxy server*) to the computer that you really want to connect to.

This all sounds quite complicated, but once things are configured
properly it is really simple to log on to the host.

Setting up a proxy in PuTTY
---------------------------

.. warning::

   In the screenshots, we show the proxy setup for user ``vscXXXXX`` to
   the ``login.muk.gent.vsc`` login node for the muk cluster at UGent
   via the login node ``vsc.login.node``.
   You will have to

   #. replace ``vscXXXXX`` with your own VSC account, and
   #. replace ``login.muk.gent.vsc`` by the node that is behind a
      a firewall that you want to acces, and
   #. find the name of the login node for the cluster you want
      to use use as a proxy in the sections of :ref:`the local VSC
      clusters <hardware>`, and replace ``vsc.login.node`` accordingly.

Setting up the connection in PuTTY is a bit more complicated than for a
simple direct connection to a login node.

#. First you need to start up pageant and load your private key into it.
   :ref:`See the instructions on our "Using Pageant"
   page <using Pageant>`.

#. In PuTTY, go first to the \\"Proxy\" category (under
   \\"Connection\"). In the Proxy tab sheet, you need to fill in the
   following information:

   .. figure:: setting_up_a_ssh_proxy_with_putty/putty_proxy_section.png

   #. Select the proxy type: "Local"                     
   #. Give the name of the "proxy  server\". This is *vsc.login.node*,
      your usual   VSC login node, and not the computer on which you
      want to log on and work.               
   #. Make sure that the "Port" number is 22.                  
   #. Enter your VSC-id in the "Username" field.           
   #. In the "Telnet command, or local proxy command\", enter the string ::

          plink -agent -l %user %proxyhost -nc %host:%port

      .. note::

         "plink" (PuTTY Link) is  a Windows program and comes with the full
         PuTTY suite of applications. It is the command line version of PuTTY.
         In case you've only installed the executables putty.exe and
         pageant.exe, you'll need to download plink.exe also from* the `PuTTY`_
         web site We strongly advise to simply install the whole PuTTY-suite of
         applications  using the installer provided on the `PuTTY download
         site`_.

#. Now go to the "Data" category in PuTTY, again under "Connection".

   .. figure:: setting_up_a_ssh_proxy_with_putty/putty_data_section.png

   #. Fill in your VSC-id in the "Auto-login username" field.
   #. Leave the other values untouched (likely the values
      in the screen dump)         

#. Now go to the "Session category

   .. figure:: setting_up_a_ssh_proxy_with_putty/putty_session_section.png

   #. Set the field \\"Host Name (or IP address) to the computer 
      you want to log on to. If you are setting up a proxy
      connection to access a computer on the VSC network. 
      you will have to use its name on the internal VSC network.  
      E.g., for the login nodes of the tier-1 cluster Muk at     
      UGent, this is **login.muk.gent.vsc** and for the cluster
      on which you can test applications for the Muk, this is
      **gligar.gligar.gent.vsc**.   
   #. Make sure that the "Port" number is 22.                 
   #. Finally give the configuration a name in the field "Saved  
      Sessions" and press "Save". Then you won't have to enter
      all the above information again.            
   #. And now you're all set up to go. Press the "Open" button
      on the "Session" tab to open a terminal window.       

For advanced users
------------------

If you have an X-server on your Windows PC, you can also use X11
forwarding and run X11-applications on the host. All you need to do is
click the box next to "Enable X11 forwarding" in the category
"Connection" -> "SSH"-> "X11".

What happens behind the scenes:

-  By specifying \\"local\" as the proxy type, you tell PuTTY to not use
   one of its own build-in ways of setting up a proxy, but to use the
   command that you specify in the \\"Telnet command\" of the \\"Proxy\"
   category.

-  In the command ::

      plink -agent -l %user %proxyhost -nc %host:%port
          
   ``%user`` will be replaced by the userid you specify in the "Proxy"
   category screen, %proxyhost will be replaced by the host you specify
   in the "Proxy" category screen (**vsc.login.node** in the
   example), %host by the host you specified in the "Session"
   category (login.muk.gent.vsc in the example) and %port by the number
   you specified in the "Port" field of that screen (and this will
   typically be 22).

-  The plink command will then set up a connection to ``%proxyhost`` using
   the userid %user. The ``-agent`` option tells plink to use pageant for
   the credentials. And the -nc option tells plink to tell the SSH
   server on ``%proxyhost`` to further connect to ``%host:%port``.
