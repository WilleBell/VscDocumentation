:fab:`apple` Generating keys on macOS
#####################################

Requirements:

* macOS operating system
* OpenSSH

Every macOS install comes with its own implementation of OpenSSH, so you
don't need to install any third-party software to use it. Just open a
Terminal window and jump in! Because of this, you can use the same
commands as specified in the on the ":ref:`generating keys linux`"
section to access the cluster and transfer files.

Create a public/private key pair
================================

Generating a public/private key pair is identical to what is described
for the :ref:`linux client <generating keys linux>`, that is, by using the
ssh-keygen command in a Terminal window.
