How much disk space am I using?

In the case of the file systems of VSC compute clusters, you can check the
total space currently used by your account in your VSC account page or from the
terminal interface of the cluster. See ':ref:`checking storage usage`' for more
information.

Alternatively, on VSC clusters or any Linux system, you can also use the
:ref:`terminal to check the total size of any folder <du command>`.
