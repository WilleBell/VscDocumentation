:fas:`user-circle` Accounts and access
######################################

In order to use the infrastructure of the VSC, you need a VSC user-ID,
also called a VSC account. Check the `VSC website <eligible users_>`_
for conditions.

All VSC-accounts start with the letters ``vsc`` followed by a
five-digit number. The first digit gives information about your home
institution. There is no relationship with your name, nor is the
information about the link between VSC-accounts and your name publicly
accessible.

Your VSC account gives you access to most of the VSC Tier-2 infrastructure,
though for some more specialized hardware you may have to ask access separately.
The rationale is that  we want to ensure that that specialized (usually rather
expensive) hardware is used efficiently for the type of applications it was
purchased for.  Contact your `local VSC coordinator <get in touch_>`_ to arrange
access when required.

For the main Tier-1 compute cluster you need to submit a
`Tier-1 project application`_ (or you should be covered by a project
application within your research group).

Before you apply for VSC account, it is useful to first check whether the
infrastructure is suitable for your application. Windows or macOS programs for
instance cannot run on our infrastructure as we use the Linux operating system
on the clusters. The infrastructure also should not be used to run applications
for which the compute power of a good laptop is sufficient. The pages on the
:ref:`tier1 hardware` and :ref:`tier2 hardware` give a high-level description
of our infrastructure. You can find more detailed information in the user
documentation on the user portal. When in doubt, you can also contact your
:ref:`local support team <contact VSC>`. This does not require a VSC account.
