How can I request more disk quota?
##################################

If the current quota limits of your :ref:`personal storage <data location>` or
:ref:`Virtual Organization (VO) <virtual_organization>` are not large enough to
carry out your research project, it might be possible to increase them. This
option depends on data storage policies of the site managing your VSC account,
VO or Tier-1 project as well as on current capacity of the storage system.

Before requesting more storage, please check carefully the :ref:`current data
usage of your VSC account <checking storage usage>` and identify which file system
needs a larger quota.

Once you have identified the file system that needs the increase, follow the
corresponding instructions to submit your request:

* :ref:`more quota personal`
* :ref:`more quota vo`
* :ref:`more tier1 quota`
* :ref:`more quota inode`
