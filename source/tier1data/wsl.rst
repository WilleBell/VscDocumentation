Installing WSL2 on Windows
==========================

As a Windows user if you don't already use any virtualisation system to operate Linux you can install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

To be able to install WSL 2 on your Windows 10, you need the following:

- Windows 10 May 2020 (2004), Windows 10 May 2019 (1903), or Windows 10 November 2019 (1909) or later
- Hyper-V Virtualization support

Users who are using a system managed by KU Leuven should fulfill these requirements. 

The requirements can be checked as follows:

To know your Windows version, type ``winver`` on your search bar, a informative popup appears.

The installation of WSL2 will consist of the following steps:

Enable WSL 2,
Enable ‘Virtual Machine Platform',
Set WSL 2 as default,
Install a Linux distro.
We will complete all steps by using Power Shell of Windows. However you can do some of the steps by graphical screens as an option. Here you can find all steps:

Run Windows PowerShell as administrator,
Type the following to enable WSL:
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

To enable Virtual Machine Platform on Windows 10 (2004), execute the following command:
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

To set WSL 2 as default execute the command below (You might need to restart your PC):
wsl --set-default-version 2

To install your Linux distribution of choice (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is recommended to install the following iRODS packages easily) on Windows 10, open the Microsoft Store app, search for it, and click the “Get” button.
The first time you launch a newly installed Linux distribution, a console window will open and you'll be asked to wait for a minute or two.
You will then need to create a user account and password for your new Linux distribution. This password will give you ‘sudo' rights when asked.
If you see ‘WSLRegisterDistribution Failed with Error:' or you may find that things don't work as intended you should restart your system at this point.
After all these steps when you type ‘wsl' to your Windows PowerShell, you will be directed to your Ubuntu machine mounted on your Windows' C drive. From now on, you can execute all Linux commands. It is advised to use the home directory instead of your Windows drives. So if you type ‘cd‘ you will be forwarded to your Ubuntu home.

You can also install (optional) the Windows Terminal app, which enables multiple tabs operation, search feature, and custom themes etc.
