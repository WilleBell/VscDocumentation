.. _Anansi cluster:

Anansi Cluster
==============

The VUB Anansi cluster is a small system designed for interactive use and
test/debug jobs. It sits next to :ref:`Hydra cluster` and both clusters share the
same network and :ref:`storage system <VUB storage>`, which simplifies testing
those jobs that will be run on Hydra.

The particularity of Anansi is that its computational resources are distributed
following a non-exclusive policy. This means that resources such as CPU cores
and GPUs allocated to jobs in Anansi might be shared with other jobs. The only
resource that is kept exclusive is system memory.

Shared resources combined with a maximum walltime of 12 hours maximizes the
availability of this cluster for quick interactive use and test/debug tasks,
avoiding wait time in queue.
