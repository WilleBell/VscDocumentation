Most VSC sites offer some form of support for visualization software through
Virtual Network Computing (VNC). VNC renders images on the cluster and
transfers the resulting images to your client device. VNC clients are available
for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS or can be even used directly on web
browsers.
