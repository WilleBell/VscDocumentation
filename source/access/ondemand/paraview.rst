      For visualization purposes, you may use the `ParaView app <https://www.paraview.org/>`_.
      Similar to the :ref:`MATLAB app <ood_matlab>`, ParaView also runs inside a `noVNC`_
      desktop as a compute job.

      .. note::

         Currently, using GPUs in ParaView is not supported yet, and just the CPU-only modules are offered.
