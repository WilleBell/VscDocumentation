ParaView
--------

For visualization purposes, you may use the `ParaView app <https://www.paraview.org/>`_.
Similar to the :ref:`MATLAB app <ood_matlab_app>`, ParaView also runs inside a `noVNC`_
desktop as a compute job.

**Remarks:**

- Currently, using GPUs in ParaView is not supported yet, and just the CPU-only modules are offered.
