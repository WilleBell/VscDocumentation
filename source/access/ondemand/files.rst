Files
=====

This menu provides a file explorer that allows you to navigate through your
files and folders.  You can access your ``$VSC_HOME`` and ``$VSC_DATA`` folders.
Depending on the institution, other storages may also be available.  General
file explorer options like moving, deleting, modifying and creating files or
directories are available as well.  You can also use this interface to download
and upload files to and from your local machine. Be aware that this is not
recommended for very large files.

For large files we recommend the :ref:`globus platform`.  The ``Globus`` button
takes you directly to the Globus login page, and upon a successful login to your
Globus account (using your institution credentials), you will land on the same
sub-directory from which you clicked on the Globus button.

**Good to know:** the standard 'ctrl+s' does not save your edited files on Open
OnDemand, but will trigger a save on your local machine. Luckily, there is a
``Save`` button in the upper left corner on the editor page.
