GaussView
---------

The GaussView app will launch `GaussView <https://gaussian.com/gaussview6>`_
in a minimal desktop environment in an interactive job.

VSC clusters that support the GaussView app:

.. grid:: 3
    :gutter: 4

    .. grid-item-card:: |VUB|
       :columns: 12 4 4 4

       .. TODO use links

       * Tier-2 Hydra
       * Tier-2 Anansi

|VUB| This app is only available for users with a VUB affiliation.

All documentation in the :ref:`ood_desktop` app also applies to this GaussView app.

.. note::

   There is an issue with the GaussView graphical interface when setting
   the compression level to zero, causing it to crash when performing certain
   actions. Make sure to set the compression level to a value that is higher
   than zero to avoid this issue.
