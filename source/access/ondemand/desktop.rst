Desktop
-------

The Desktop app will launch a light-weight (Xfce) desktop environment in an
interactive job. Its main purpose is to run graphical software for which there
isnâ€™t (yet) a dedicated app available.

VSC clusters that support the Desktop app:

.. grid:: 3
    :gutter: 4

    .. grid-item-card:: |VUB|
       :columns: 12 4 4 4

       .. TODO use links

       * Tier-2 Hydra
       * Tier-2 Anansi


For optimal performance, we recommend the following workflow:

#. Launch the app in the ``Anansi`` cluster and request a GPU.
#. In the desktop environment, open a terminal window and load the module of
   your graphical software
#. Launch the executable with ``vglrun`` to enable hardware acceleration:

   .. code-block:: bash

      vglrun <executable>

.. tip::

   Once the Desktop app is active, you can give view-only access to other VSC
   users. In the 'My Interactive Sessions' menu, right-click the 'View Only
   (Share-able Link)' button to copy the link and share it with others. Anyone
   with the link can view your Desktop session in real-time, which is especially
   helpful for job troubleshooting and hands-on training.
