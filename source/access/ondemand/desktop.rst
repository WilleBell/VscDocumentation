      The Desktop app will launch a light-weight (Xfce) desktop environment in
      an interactive job. Its main purpose is to run graphical software for
      which there isnâ€™t (yet) an app available.

      For optimal performance, we recommend the following workflow:

      #. Launch the app in the ``Anansi`` cluster and request a GPU.
      #. In the desktop environment, open a terminal window and load the module of your graphical software
      #. Launch the executable with ``vglrun`` to enable hardware acceleration:

         .. code-block:: bash

            vglrun <executable>
