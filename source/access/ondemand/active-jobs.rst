Active jobs
-----------

The 'Active Jobs' page lists all your running, queued and completed jobs.
Depending on the cluster, completed jobs will be removed from this view within a
timeframe ranging from a few minutes to one day.  A handy overview of multiple job
details is shown by clicking the large arrow at the left side of the job id,
including the node list, the account you used, the status of the job, and more.
It also gives you the option to open the job script directory in the file
manager or in the terminal, and thus inspect the created output and error files.

If your job is still running, you can also delete it by clicking the bin under 'Actions'.
The 'Active jobs' page does not support re-submission of your job; How to
(re-)submit jobs will be made clear in the next chapters.
