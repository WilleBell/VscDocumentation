Active jobs
-----------

The 'Jobs - Active Jobs' menu item lists all your running, queued and completed
jobs. Completed jobs will disappear from this view after some time (a couple of
minutes or one day, depending on the cluster).  A handy overview of job details
is shown by clicking the large arrow at the left side of the job id, including
the node list, the account you used, the status of the job, and more.  It also
gives you the option to open the job script directory in the file manager or in
the terminal, and thus inspect the created output and error files.

If your job is still running, you can also delete it by clicking the bin under
'Actions'. Re-submitting a previous job can be done via the 'My Interactive
Sessions' menu or in the :ref:`ood_job_composer`.
