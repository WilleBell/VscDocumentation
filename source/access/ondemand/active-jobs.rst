Active jobs
-----------

The 'Jobs - Active Jobs' menu item lists all your running, queued and completed jobs.
Depending on the cluster, completed jobs will be removed from this view within a
timeframe ranging from a few minutes to one day.  A handy overview of multiple job
details is shown by clicking the large arrow at the left side of the job id,
including the node list, the account you used, the status of the job, and more.
It also gives you the option to open the job script directory in the file
manager or in the terminal, and thus inspect the created output and error files.

If your job is still running, you can also delete it by clicking the bin under
'Actions'. Re-submitting a previous job can be done via the 'My Interactive
Sessions' menu or in the :ref:`ood_job_composer`.
