Jobs
====

All jobs submitted from Open OnDemand can run on the available clusters.
This also means that all your jobs should be submitted as **Slurm** jobs.
For more details on how to run jobs on the different VSC clusters, check out
their respective documentation.

Depending on the institution, the 'Jobs' menu may have one or two items: 'Active Jobs',
and optionally 'Job Composer'.

.. and 'Projects' (which we skip here, because at the time of this writing, it is still in development by the upstream).
