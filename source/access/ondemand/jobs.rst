Jobs
====

All jobs submitted from Open OnDemand will run on any the supported clusters.
This means that all your jobs should be submitted as *Slurm* jobs.
For more details on how to run jobs on the different VSC clusters, check out
the corresponding documentation:

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: KU Leuven/UHasselt


      :ref:`wICE quick start guide<wice_t2_leuven>`


   .. tab-item:: VUB

      `Job submission documentation <https://hpc.vub.be/docs/job-submission/>`_

Depending on the institution, the 'Jobs' menu may have one or two items: :ref:`Active Jobs<ood_active_jobs>`,
and possibly :ref:`Job Composer<ood_job_composer>`.

.. and 'Projects' (which we skip here, because at the time of this writing, it is still in development by the upstream).

.. include:: active-jobs.rest

.. include:: job-composer.rest
