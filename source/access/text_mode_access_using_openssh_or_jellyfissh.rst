.. _mac openssh access:

Text-mode access using OpenSSH
==============================

Prerequisites
-------------

- macOS comes with its own implementation of OpenSSH, so you don't need
  to install any third-party software to use it. Just open a Terminal
  window and jump in!

Using OpenSSH on macOS
----------------------

You can use the same commands as specified in the
:ref:`Linux client section <linux_client>` to access the cluster and transfer
files:

* :ref:`ssh-keygen <generating keys linux>` to generate the keys
* :ref:`ssh <OpenSSH access>` to log on to the cluster
* :ref:`scp and sftp <scp and sftp>` for file transfer

.. _mac jellyfissh access:

Text-mode access using JellyfiSSH
=================================

|Optional| You can use `JellyfiSSH`_ to store your ssh session settings.

Prerequisites
-------------

Install `JellyfiSSH`_. The most recent version is available for a small fee
from the Mac App Store, but if you search for *JellyfiSSH 4.5.2*, which is the
version used for the screenshots in this page, you might still find some free
downloads for that version.

Installation is easy: just drag the program's icon to the Application folder in
the Finder, and you're done.

Using JellyfiSSH for bookmarking ssh connection settings
--------------------------------------------------------

You can use JellyfiSSH to create a user-friendly bookmark for your ssh
connection settings. To do this, follow these steps:

#. Start JellyfiSSH and select 'New'. This will open a window where you
   can specify the connection settings.

#. In the 'Host or IP' field, type in <vsc-loginnode>. In the 'Login
   name' field, type in your <vsc-account>.
   In the screenshot below we have filled in the fields for a connection
   to the Genius cluster at KU Leuven as user vsc98765.

#. You might also want to change the Terminal window settings, which can
   be done by clicking on the icon in the lower left corner of the
   JellyfiSSH window.

#. When done, provide a name for the bookmark in the 'Bookmark Title'
   field and press 'Add' to create the bookmark.

#. To make a connection, select the bookmark in the 'Bookmark' field and
   click on 'Connect'. Optionally, you can make the bookmark the default
   by selecting it as the 'Startup Bookmark' in the JellyfiSSH >
   Preferences menu entry.
