MATLAB parallel computing
=========================

General
-------

Matlab allows you to use parallel computing on a HPC cluster using the `Parallel Computing Toolbox <https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html>`_.
The toolbox is needed to create a cluster profile and it is this profile that will allow you to submit multi-node jobs.

KU Leuven clusters
------------------

Availability
++++++++++++

The Parallel Computing Toolbox has been enabled for all Matlab versions on the KU Leuven Tier-2 clusters. 

The Matlab license of KU Leuven covers all academic users. If you would like to use Matlab, but you are not part of our Matlab group and would like to use this 
software, we kindly ask you to contact our helpdesk and request access.

Configuring Matlab for parallel computing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

While the functionality is available, there is some minor work on userside to set up Matlab for use on multiple nodes. Here, these steps are explained.

Running Matlab is best done from a compute node. Request an interactive job with minimum 4 cores (Matlab loading is quite slow with only a single core) with the 
`srun` or `salloc` command.

Now you will can load your preferred Matlab module:

::
    $ module load <matlab_module>

We have Matlab modules available for wICE (in the 2021a toolchain) and for Genius (in the 2021a and 2018a toolchain).

Now, start Matlab and use the function  `configCluster` to set up the cluster profile. If you do not do this, the cluster profile will default to the 'local 
cluster', basically meaning that it will only detect the cores on the node you are currently on. 

::
    $ matlab -nodisplay          # this will avoid launching the GUI, but you can do this if you prefer (slow)
    $ # Within Matlab
    $ >> configCluster;

There is a range of additional properties that you can set on the cluster profile. Before you can edit these, you first need to get a handle on the cluster
profile:

:: 
    $ c=parcluster;

You can then view and edit the additional properties:

::
    $ # Access
    $ c.AdditionalProperties     
    $
    $ #edit
    $ c.AdditionalProperties.<property_name> = '<property_value>'

One of these properties, you will always have to set, namely `AccountName`. Set this to the name of your credit account.

Next to this, it is also possible to change the more standard parameters of the cluster profile. One of these is the `JobStorageLocation` parameter. This defaults
to a location in your `$VSC_HOME`. If you are producing a lot of output, it might be good to change this location to e.g. `$VSC_DATA`. Changing this, or any of
the other cluster profile parameters can be done as follows:

::
    $ # Access
    $ c.JobStorageLocation = '</path/to/your/custom/jobdir>'

Both after changing any of the additional properties or the standard parameters, you will have to save that profile to keep the changes after closing your 
session:

::
    $ c.saveProfile;


Submitting jobs
+++++++++++++++

Submitting jobs will happen from within Matlab. There are two ways to do this. You can start a Matlab session on a login node, or you can first request an
interactive job, where you launch your Matlab session. Which one you choose will depend on the workload you plan to have on the node before submitting a job.
As for any other work on the cluster, you can always do minor work on the login node, but for heavier calculations (before submitting your multinode job), you 
should use an interactive job. 

In general, we recommend to carry out the examples below via Matlab's command line interface (as shown in the configuration section). It is also possible to use 
the Matlab GUI, in which case it is best to do this via a NoMachine connection. If you then need to launch the Matlab GUI in an interactive job, don't forget to 
add ``-X`` option to your `srun` or `salloc`command and keep in mind that the GUI will necessarily be less responsive.

Now you can start both interactive and independent batch jobs with the previously configured cluster profile. Follow the steps below to submit a job.

Interactive job
***************

You can start an interactive job using the ``parpool`` function:

::

    >> c = parcluster;
    >> p = c.parpool(4); % requesting 4 cores
    
Once the job starts, all your following commands will be executed in the parpool command you requested.

You can stop the parpool job by using `p.delete`.
    
Batch job
*********

Batch jobs are started with the ``batch`` function. Here we will give you an example job where we query the working directories of each of the threads Matlab is 
using. Have a look at the `Matlab documentation <https://www.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/run-a-batch-job.html>`_ for more information.

::

    >> c = parcluster;
    >> job = c.batch(@pwd, 1, {}, 'CurrentFolder','.', 'AutoAddClientPath',false);
    >> % request the job status
    >> job.State
    >> % Get the job outputs
    >> job.fetchOutputs{:}
    >> % delete the job
    >> job.delete

If you are running multiple jobs, you can get an overview of all jobs as follows:

::

    >> jobs = c.Jobs;
    
To get for example the output of the second job in this list, you can use the following:

::

    >> job2 = c.Jobs(2);
    >> job2.fetchOutputs{:}
