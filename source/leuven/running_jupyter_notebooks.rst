How to run a Jupyter notebook on a compute node
===============================================

Jupyter notebooks provide a very convenient way for Python programmers
to explore and visualize data interactively, or do exploratory programming.
Typically, a notebook server runs on your own computer, and you connect
to it using a web browser (actually, the web browser will be started
automatically).

Although this is very convenient and easy to use, for more computationally
intensive work you may want to run the notebook server on a compute node
of a VSC cluster (we'll assume you using thinking here, but the approach
works for all our clusters).


Prerequisites
-------------

The most convenient way to install Jupyter, and any other Python packages
you require is using conda.  In case you're not familiar with conda, please
check out the information on :ref:`managing Python packages using conda
<conda for Python>`.

.. warning::

   Pay attention to the warning `not` to let the installation script modify
   your ``.bashrc`` file.

In this how-to, we will assume that the conda environment's name that has
Jupyter installed is ``science``.  We will also assume that the
``$VSC_DATA/miniconda3/bin`` directory is in your ``PATH`` variable.


Using a notebook on an NX node
------------------------------

Prerequisite: NoMachine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although alternatives exist, the easiest approach is to use the NX login nodes, since this provides a GUI environment on a cluster login node.  The installation and setup of the NoMachine software on your computer is documented in the :ref:``quick start guide<NX start guide>`.  Once NoMachine is installed and configured, you can connect to the cluster.

Starting the server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to run a Jupyter notebook server, since this has to be done on a compute node, we first start an interactive job.

::

   $ qsub  -I  -l walltime=4:00:00

The ``-I`` flag specifies this is an interactive job, and we request 4 hours walltime.  Note that you would probably have to add the `-A` option with the project to debit for credits.

Once your job starts, you'll see the name of the node the job is running on in the shell prompt.  In this tutorial, we will assume it is ``r5i1n7``.

Navigate to the relevant directory where your notebook is stored, or where you intend to create a new one.

Load the conda environment, `science` in this tutorial:

::

   $ source activate science


Start a Jupyter notebook server:

::

   $ jupyter notebook

When Jupyter has started, the last line of output will be the URL to point your web browser to, e.g.,
::

   http://localhost:8888/?token=56262fe0755d2321911f96df8c3c98e651f24238452035d9

Connecting the client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we have to establish an SSH tunnel from the NX login node to the
compute node.  This is required so that the web browser running on the
login node can communicate with the Jupyter server on the compute node.

On the NX login node, start another shell, and create a tunnel to the
compute node (`r5i1n7`).  As a port number, use the five digits of your
VSC account, this should ensure that there are no conflicts, e.g., if your
VSC account is vsc30140, use 30140 as port number:

::
   $ ssh -L 30140:localhost:8888 -N r5i1n7.genius.hpc.kuleuven.be

Now, start Firefox on the NX login node, and browse to the link the
Jupyter notebook server displayed.  Enjoy.


Using a notebook by tunneling from a Linux machine to a genius GPU node
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions:

  1. The local machine's name is ``local``.
  2. The VSC account is vsc30140, replace with your own.
  3. The project to charge is ``lp_my_project``, replace with your own.
  4. The port number is 30140, replace with the numerical part of your VSC account.
  5. The conda environment in which Jupyter notebook is installed is ``machine_learning``, again, replace with your own.
  6. The GPU node the job is running on is ``r23g36``, replace with the hostname of the node your job runs on.


Start a job & a notebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, start an interactive job on a compute node, and launch Jupyter
notebook.


Detailed steps:

    1. Log in the the genius login node using ssh:
       ::

          local$ ssh vsc30140@login3-tier2.hpc.kuleuven.be

    2. Start an interactive job on a GPU node:
       ::
        
          login3$ qsub -I -A lp_my_project -l nodes=1:ppn=9:gpus=1 \
                       -l partition gpu -l walltime=03:00:00
       
    3. When the job is running on the GPU node, activate your environment:  
       ::

          r23g36$ source activate machine_learning

    4. Go to the relevant directory, e.g., ``$VSC_DATA``.
    5. Start the Jupyter notebook, use a unique port number:
       ::
          r23g36$ jupyter notebook --port 30140

Set up SSH tunnel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, you set up a first tunnel from your machine to the GPU node on the SSH port of the GPU node.

Detailed steps:

::

   local$ ssh -J vsc30140@login1-tier2.hpc.kuleuven.be \
              -L 30140:localhost:30140                 \
              vsc30140@r23g36

**Note:** this command will not exit, if you like to do everything in one
terminal, put the process in the background using `&`.


Open the interface to Jupyter notebook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, open your web browser on your local machine, copy/paste the
link that Jupyter notebook displays into your browser, and *presto!*
