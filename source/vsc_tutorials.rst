Site Tutorials
==============

VSC sites carry out regular trainings about Linux and the VSC HPC systems. 
You may always find the updated list of trainings via the `VSC Training`_
website. It is complementary to the information found in this user portal, the
latter being the reference manual. Below you can find links  to those training
materials.

KULeuven/UHasselt

The training material (slides and exercises) for a variety of HPC-related trainings from
the KULeuven/UHasselt site are organized via the 
`official Github repository <https://github.com/hpcleuven>`__.
