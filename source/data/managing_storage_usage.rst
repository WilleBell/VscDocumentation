.. _quota:

File system quota
=================

VSC file systems can have 2 types of quota set on them:

* quota on the *storage space*
* quota on the *number of inodes*

The number of inodes limits the maximum number of files that can be present in
the file system (although there is no one-to-one relation between inodes and
number of files).

The inode and space quota allow site admins to control the amount of data and/or
number of files users create, and to prevent system wide problems in case of
unexpected behavior, such as runaway jobs filling up the available space or
creating too many files. A filesystem that runs out of space or inodes affects
all users immediately.  It is also a way to raise usersâ€™ awareness of the data
their jobs produce, as storage is a limited resource and should be used
responsibly.

.. _checking storage usage:

Total space used on file systems with quota
============================================

On file systems with quota enabled, you can check the amount of storage space
that is available for you, and the amount of storage space that is in use by
you.

VSC account page
----------------

Your VSC account page shows up-to-date information about your storage usage on
each of the file systems accessible to your account. This information is
available in the *Usage* section of the
`View Account <https://account.vscentrum.be>`_ tab and includes:

* total data size
* current quota limit
* percentage use
* number of files used (*inodes*)

You will find the usage data for your :ref:`personal storage <data location>`
space such as ``VSC_HOME``, ``VSC_DATA`` and ``VSC_SCRATCH`` as well as your
:ref:`Virtual Organization <vo>` if you are in one.

Terminal in the cluster
-----------------------

On the system of most VSC clusters, ``myquota`` will show you for the
``$VSC_HOME``, ``$VSC_DATA`` and ``$VSC_SCRATCH`` file systems either the
percentage of the available storage space you are using, or the absolute amount.
Users from Ghent university should check their storage usage using the `web
application <https://account.vscentrum.be/>`_.

If quota have been set on the number of files you can create on a file
system, those are listed as well.

Example::

   $ myquota
   file system $VSC_DATA
       using 35G of 75G, 1126k of 10000k files
   file system $VSC_HOME
       using 2401M of 3072M, 40342 of 100k files
   file system $VSC_SCRATCH
       using 5.82G of 100G

.. warning::

   If your file usage approaches the limits, jobs may crash unexpectedly.


.. _du command:

Space used by individual directories
====================================

.. warning::

   The ``du`` command will stress the file system, and all file systems
   are shared, so please use it wisely and sparingly.

The command to check the size of  all subdirectories in the current
directory is ``du``::

   $ du -h
   4.0k      ./.ssh
   0         ./somedata/somesubdir
   52.0k     ./somedata
   56.0k     .

This shows you first the aggregated size of all subdirectories, and
finally the total size of the current directory "``.``" (this includes
files stored in the current directory). The ``-h`` option ensures
that sizes are displayed in human-readable form (kB, MB, GB), omitting
it will   show sizes in bytes.

If the directory contains a deep hierarchy of subdirectories,
you may not want to see the information at that depth; you
could just ask for a summary of the current directory::

   $ du -s
   54864 .

If you want to see the size of any file or top level subdirectory in the current
directory, you could use the following command::

   du -s *
   12      a.out
   3564    core
   4       mpd.hosts
   51200   somedata
   4       start.sh
   4       test

Finally, if you don't want to know the size of the data in your
current directory, but in some other directory (e.g., your data
directory), you just pass this directory as a parameter::

   du -h -s $VSC_DATA/input_data/*
   50M     /data/leuven/300/vsc30001/input_data/somedata
